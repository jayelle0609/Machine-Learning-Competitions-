# Road Accident Risk Prediction using XGB Regressor

**Model Accuracy (RMSE):** 0.05569

This project predicts the likelihood of road accidents based on various environmental and road conditions. The model helps in understanding high-risk scenarios and can assist in preventive measures for road safety.

## Features & Approach

* **Data Preprocessing:**

  * StandardScaler for numerical features
  * OneHotEncoding for categorical features
* **Modeling:**

  * XGB Regressor implemented in a pipeline
  * Hyperparameters tuned using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize performance
* **Performance Metric:**

  * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 0.05569

## Usage

1. Preprocess dataset (numerical and categorical features)
2. Fit the pipeline with training data
3. Predict accident risk for new input conditions

## Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* `xgboost`
* `scikit-learn`
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
