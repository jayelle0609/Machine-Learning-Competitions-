# 🏆 Kaggle Machine Learning Competitions Folder (with final model score)

Welcome to my collection of **Kaggle competition projects**!
This repository showcases my code, experiments, and final scores from various machine learning challenges I’ve participated in. Each folder corresponds to a specific competition and includes my approach, notebooks, and final scores.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each subfolder typically includes:

* 🧠 **EDA & feature engineering** notebooks
* ⚙️ **Model selection training scripts** (LightGBM, XGBoost, deep learning, etc.)
* ⚙️ **Model parameter tuning** (GridSearchCV, RandomSearchCV, etc.)
* 📊 **Validation results & submissions & final score (+ metric used)**
