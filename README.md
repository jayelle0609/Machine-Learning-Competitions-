# 👩‍💻📚 Machine Learning Competition - Algorithms Code

Welcome to my collection of **Kaggle competition projects**!


This repository showcases my code notebooks, models and final scores from various machine learning challenges I’ve participated in. 

Each folder corresponds to a specific competition.

## 📂 Repository Structure
My workflow typically includes:

1. EDA  
   - Visualizations with plotly, matplotlib, seaborn to detect outliers or unreasonable values (ex. age is 200)
 
2. Feature Engineering / Dimension Reduction / Removing influence of unimportant features  
   - Create new features if necessary (to reduce dimensionality!)  
   - Feature importance selection with L1 Lasso Linear Regression or Tree Based Models.  
     - Lasso : These select the most important features, shrink coefficients of unimportant features with a penalty to zero.  
     - Tree : Rank feature importance and select top ones only (tree)  
   - Dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, t-SNE, LDA if there are too many variables)  
     - These create new features by combining old ones.  

3. Data Preprocessing  
   - Imputation of missing values  
   - StandardScaler for numerical variables  
   - Onehotencoding for Categorical Variables  
   - Pipelines : ColumnTransformer (preprocessor for cat and num variables)  

4. Model selection based on evaluation metrics  

5. Model hyperparameter tuning  
   - GridSearchCV, RandomSearchCV, etc.  

6. Validation results after hyperparameter tuning, submissions & final score (+ metric used)  
   - Sometimes a generic model offers greater accuracy for unseen data!
